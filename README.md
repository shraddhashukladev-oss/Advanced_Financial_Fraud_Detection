# Advanced_Financial_Fraud_Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in financial datasets using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical transaction data, the model identifies potential frauds in real-time, helping organizations minimize financial losses.

The project demonstrates a complete data analysis and machine learning workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization. It also includes Power BI dashboards for interactive reporting of fraud patterns and predictions.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends, patterns, and class imbalance in fraudulent transactions.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model accuracy.

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and optional time-series ARIMA/SARIMA for pattern detection.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC for classification models.

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Power BI dashboards for interactive insights.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Power BI, Jupyter Notebook.

Use Case:

Banks and financial institutions can identify fraudulent transactions proactively.

Helps in reducing financial losses and improving risk management.
